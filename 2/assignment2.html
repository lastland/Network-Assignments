<h2> Assignment #2 - Implementing the Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) Routing Protocol</h2>
 
    <p>
      <b><span class="emph">Due by 11:59pm, Nov. 12, 2011.</span></b>
    </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the link cost change can be either a positive number or
a negative one. E.g., the cost between A-B can be changed from 2.0 to 4.0,
or changed from 2.0 to -1. A negative one such as -1 means that the link is broken/down.
</p>


<h3>Assignment requirements:</h3>
    <p>
      In this assignment you are asked to implement the destination sequenced distance vector (DSDV) routing
      protocol discussed in class.  Your program will be running at the provided Linux testbed. 
      At each host, the input to your program is the set of directly 
      attached links and their costs.  <span class="emph">Note that the program 
      at each host doesn't know the complete network topology.</span>  Your 
      routing program at each host should report the cost and the next hop for 
      the shortest paths to all other hosts in the network.  This is an individual 
      assignment, so each person should turn in his/her own program.
    </p>
 
    <p>
      In DSDV, each host sends out the routing information to its 
      neighbors at a certain frequency (e.g., once every 10 seconds), no matter if the
      information has changed since the last announcement.  This strategy improves the 
      robustness of the protocol.  For instance, a lost message will be 
      automatically recovered by later messages.  In this strategy, typically a host
      re-computes its distance vector and routing table right before sending out the 
      routing information to its neighbors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we don't have real network routers for you to play with, your programs will 
      run on machines in the testbed.  As specified in the
      distance vector protocols, your routing program at each host will exchange
      the routing information with directly connected neighbors.  Real routing 
      protocols use UDP for such exchanges.  Under such a scheme, each host 
      should listen at a UDP port for incoming routing messages.
    </p>

<h4>Input format:</h4>
    <p>
      Your program at host <code>n1</code> should take a text file as input, 
      which describes the set of directly attached links and their costs.  The 
      first line of the text file is a single number and a string, where the number 
      specify the total number of directly attached links and the string specify
	  the name of current node.  <span class="strong">All subsequent lines in the input file are in 
      the format of "<CODE>n2 machine cost port_number</CODE>", which stands for a link between node 
      <code>n1</code> and node <code>n2</code> with cost <CODE>cost</CODE>, and the program
	  of node <code>n2</code> actually is running on <code>machine</code> and listening at port <code>port_number</code>.  Note 
      that <CODE>cost</CODE> is a floating point number.  The four fields are
      separated by spaces in each line of the input file.</span> 
    </p>
 
    <p>
      Let's look at an example with the network topology shown in the following figure.
      <center><img src="network.jpg"></center> 
      The input files at all hosts will look like the following:
      <a href="a.dat">a.dat</a>, <a href="b.dat">b.dat</a>, <a href="c.dat">c.dat</a>,
      <a href="d.dat">d.dat</a>, <a href="e.dat">e.dat</a>, and <a href="f.dat">f.dat</a>.
      Note that in the above example, <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>,
	  <code>d</code>, <code>e</code>, and <code>f</code> stand for 
      real machine <code>head</code>, <code>node1</code>, and 
      <code>node2</code>, <code>node3</code>, <code>node4</code>, and <code>head</code>
	  in the testbed, respectively. <code>a</code> and <code>f</code> will use different 
	  UDP port numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be aware that we will use DIFFERENT network topologies in our testing.
    </p>

<h4>Output format:</h4>
    <p>
      Your program should produce a terminal output each time it sends out the 
      routing information to its neighbors (<i>i.e.</i>, once every 10 seconds).
      Each such output should include an incremental print-out number (1 for the
      first output, 2 for the second output, etc.).  Each output should also
      include the cost and the next hop for the shortest paths to all other 
      network nodes.  For instance, one of the terminal outputs at node 
      <code>a</code> may look like the following.
      <pre>
 ## print-out number 10
 shortest path to node b (seq# 10): the next hop is b and the cost is 2.0
 shortest path to node c (seq# 12): the next hop is d and the cost is 3.0
 shortest path to node d (seq# 10): the next hop is d and the cost is 1.0
 shortest path to node e (seq# 12): the next hop is d and the cost is 2.0
 shortest path to node f (seq# 8): the next hop is d and the cost is 4.0
      </pre>
	  In the above, "node b (seq# 10)" means the sequence number from node b is 10.
      You must produce the terminal output from the first time the host sends 
      out its routing information to its neighbors.  Yes, the first a few
      outputs often contain immature routing information.
    </p>
 
<h4>Startup and termination:</h4>
    <p>
      It is possible that some hosts may start earlier than their neighbors.  As
      a result, you might send the routing information to a neighbor which has not 
      run yet.  You should not worry about this since your routing program at each
      host will repeatedly send the routing information to its neighbors and a 
      slow-starting neighbor will eventually get the information.
    </p>

    <p>
      You program does not need to terminate.  It should keep running and outputing 
      the routing information until being killed (<i>e.g.</i>, though Ctr-C).
    </p>

<h4>Link cost change:</h4>
    <p>
      Your implementation should also be able to handle link cost changes.  
      In our test platform, link cost changes manifest as value updates in the 
      neighbor link input files.  More specifically, to emulate the cost change of a link, the input 
      files for the two nodes attached to the link should be updated.  During your 
      testing, you might not be able to update the two files simultaneously.  But 
      this is fine --- in practice the two attached nodes may not simultaneously 
      detect a link cost change either.  Due to potential link cost change, your 
      program at each host should re-read the link input file each time it is 
      about to re-compute its distance vector and routing table (typically right 
      before sending out the routing information to its neighbors).  Be aware of 
      the potential file caching at the OS --- make sure you do read the new file 
      content each time you re-read the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that you implementation only needs to support link cost changes, not 
      network topology changes.
    </p>
<h3>Turn-in:</h3>
    <p>
      You are asked to turn in your source files, a Makefile, and a README 
      file.  You should implement using C/C++ and be able to run on testbed.  Your program 
      should take two parameters: the first parameter is the listening UDP port number and
	  the second parameter is the input file that describes directly attached links) on startup.  
	  I.e., we invoke your program like:
<pre>
	  $ ./dsdv 3033 a.dat
</pre>
      Different nodes will listen at different UDP ports for routing update.  
      The README file should contain your student ID, name, e-mail address (within SJTU
	  domain), and a description of your design and implementation 
      strategies.  It should describe how to run your program (the exact parameter
      format, etc.).  Please also provide a Makefile that builds your program from
      submitted sources. The executable should be named as "dsdv".
